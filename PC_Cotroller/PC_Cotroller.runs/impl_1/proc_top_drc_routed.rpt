2. REPORT DETAILS

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net damn/u_ad/alucontrol_o_reg[2]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin damn/u_ad/alucontrol_o_reg[2]/L3_2/O, cell damn/u_ad/alucontrol_o_reg[2]/L3_2 (in damn/u_ad/alucontrol_o_reg[2] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net damn/u_md/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin damn/u_md/alucontrol_o_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell damn/u_md/alucontrol_o_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net damn/u_md/aluop__0_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin damn/u_md/alusrc/O, cell damn/u_md/alusrc. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net damn/u_md/memtoreg__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin damn/u_md/regdst/O, cell damn/u_md/regdst. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 ROM/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram has an input control pin ROM/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: ROM/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/addra[5]) which is driven by a register (pc_count/pc_o_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
